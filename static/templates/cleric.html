<h1>The Cleric</h1>

<div id="intro"><p>The lands of Dungeon World are a gods-forsaken mess. They’re lousy with the walking dead, beasts of all sorts, and the vast unnatural spaces between safe and temple-blessed civilizations. It is a godless world out there. That’s why it needs you.</p>

<p>Bringing the glory of your god to the heathens isn’t just in your nature—it’s your calling. It falls to you to proselytize with sword and mace and spell. To cleave deep into the witless heart of the wilds and plant the seed of divinity there. Some say that it is best to keep god close to your heart. You know that’s rubbish. God lives at the edge of a blade.</p>

<p>Show the world who is lord.</p></div>

<h2>Names</h2>

<div id="names"><p><em>Dwarf</em>: Durga, Aelfar, Gerda, Rurgosh, Bjorn, Drummond, Helga, Siggrun, Freya</p>

<p><em>Human</em>: Wesley, Brinton, Jon, Sara, Hawthorn, Elise, Clarke, Lenore, Piotr, Dahlia, Carmine</p></div>

<h2>Look</h2>

<div id="look"><p>Choose one for each:</p>

<p>Kind Eyes, Sharp Eyes, or Sad Eyes</p>

<p>Tonsure, Strange Hair, or Bald</p>

<p>Flowing Robes, Habit, or Common Garb</p>

<p>Thin Body, Knobby Body, or Flabby Body</p></div>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<p>Your maximum HP is 8+Constitution.</p>

<p>Your base damage is <span id="Damage">d6</span>.</p>

<h2>Starting Moves</h2>

<div id="startingmoves"><p class="InstructionsAfterHeader">Choose a race and gain the corresponding move:</p>

<div id="racialmoves"><h3 class="MoveName">Dwarf</h3>

<p>You are one with stone. When you commune you are also granted a special version of Words of the Unspeaking as a rote which only works on stone.</p>

<h3 class="MoveName">Human</h3>

<p>Your faith is diverse. Choose one wizard spell. You can cast and be granted that spell as if it was a cleric spell.</p></div>

<div id="classmoves"><p class="Instructions">You start with these moves:</p>

<div id="Deity"><h3 class="BasicMoveName">Deity</h3>

<p>You serve and worship some deity or power which grants you spells. Give your god a name (maybe Helferth, Sucellus, Zorica or Krugon the Bleak) and choose your deity’s domain:</p>

<ul><li class="Option">Healing and Restoration</li>

<li class="Option">Bloody Conquest</li>

<li class="Option">Civilization</li>

<li class="Option">Knowledge and Hidden Things</li>

<li class="Option">The Downtrodden and Forgotten</li>

<li class="Option">What Lies Beneath</li></ul>

<p>Choose one precept of your religion:</p>

<ul><li class="Option">Your religion preaches the sanctity of suffering, add Petition: Suffering</li>

<li class="Option">Your religion is cultish and insular, add Petition: Gaining Secrets</li>

<li class="Option">Your religion has important sacrificial rites, add Petition: Offering</li>

<li class="Option">Your religion believes in trial by combat, add Petition: Personal Victory</li></ul></div>

<div id="DivineGuidance"><h3 class="BasicMoveName">Divine Guidance</h3>

<p>When you <strong>petition your deity according to the precept of your religion</strong>, you are granted some useful knowledge or boon related to your deity’s domain. The GM will tell you what.</p></div>

<div id="TurnUndead"><h3 class="BasicMoveName">Turn Undead</h3>

<p>When you <strong>hold your holy symbol aloft and call on your deity for protection</strong>, roll+Wis. • On a 7+, so long as you continue to pray and brandish your holy symbol, no undead may come within reach of you. • On a 10+, you also momentarily daze intelligent undead and cause mindless undead to flee. Aggression breaks the effects and they are able to act as normal. Intelligent undead may still find ways to harry you from afar. They’re clever like that.</p></div>

<div id="Commune"><h3 class="BasicMoveName">Commune</h3>

<p>When you <strong>spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet communion with your deity</strong>, you:</p>

<ul><li>Lose any spells already granted to you.</li>

<li>Are granted new spells of your choice whose total levels don’t exceed your own level+1, and none of which is a higher level than your own level.</li>

<li>Prepare all of your rotes, which never count against your limit.</li></ul></div>

<div id="CastASpell"><h3 class="BasicMoveName">Cast a Spell</h3>

<p>When you <strong>unleash a spell granted to you by your deity</strong>, roll+Wis. • On a 10+, the spell is successfully cast and your deity does not revoke the spell, so you may cast it again. • On a 7–9, the spell is cast, but choose one:</p>

<ul><li>You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell you how.</li>

<li>Your casting distances you from your deity—take -1 ongoing to cast a spell until the next time you commune.</li>

<li>After you cast it, the spell is revoked by your deity. You cannot cast the spell again until you commune and have it granted to you.</li></ul>

<p>Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause a penalty to your roll to cast a spell.</p></div></div></div>

<h2>Alignment</h2>

<p class="InstructionsAfterHeader">Choose an alignment:</p>

<div id="alignment"><h3 class="MoveName">Good</h3>

<h2>Gear</h2>

<div id="gear"><p>Your load is 10+Str. You carry dungeon rations (5 uses, 1 weight) and some symbol of the divine, describe it (0 weight). Choose your defenses:</p>
