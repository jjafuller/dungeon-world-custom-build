<h1>The Bard</h1>

<p>The poems say an adventurer’s life is all open roads and the glory of coin and combat. The tales told in every farmhand-filled inn have to have some ring of truth to them, don’t they? The songs to inspire peasantry and royals alike—to soothe the savage beast or drive men to a frenzy—have to come from somewhere.</p>

<p>Enter the bard. You, with your smooth tongue and quick wit. You teller-of-tales and singer-of-songs. It takes a mere minstrel to retell a thing but a true bard to live it. Strap on your boots, noble orator. Sharpen that hidden dagger and take up the call. Someone’s got to be there, fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with the goons and the thugs and the soon-to-be-heroes. Who better than you to write the tale of your own heroism?</p>

<p>Nobody. Get going.</p>

<h2>Starting Moves</h2>

<li>Their mind is shaken clear of one enchantment</li>

<li>The next time someone successfully assists the target with aid, they get +2 instead of +1</li></ul>

</ul>

<p>When you <strong>first encounter an important creature, location, or item (your call) covered by your bardic lore</strong> you can ask the GM any one question about it; the GM will answer truthfully. The GM may then ask you what tale, song, or legend you heard that information in.</p>

<h3 class="BasicMoveName">Charming and Open</h3>

<p>When you <strong>speak frankly with someone</strong>, you can ask their player a question from the list below. They must answer it truthfully, then they may ask you a question from the list (which you must answer truthfully).</p>

</ul>
