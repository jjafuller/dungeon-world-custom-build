<h1>The Thief</h1>

<div id="intro"><p>You’ve heard them, sitting around the campfire. Bragging about this battle or that. About how their gods are smiling on your merry band. You count your coins and smile to yourself—this is the thrill above all. You alone know the secret of Dungeon World—filthy filthy lucre.</p>

<p>Sure, they give you lip for all the times you’ve snuck off alone but without you, who among them wouldn’t have been dissected by a flying guillotine or poisoned straight to death by some ancient needle trap? So, let them complain. When you’re done with all this delving you’ll toast their hero’s graves.</p>

<p>From your castle. Full of gold. You rogue.</p></div>

<h3 class="BasicMoveName">Trap Expert</h3>

<p>When you <strong>spend a moment to survey a dangerous area</strong>, roll+DEX. • On a 10+, hold 3. • On a 7–9, hold 1. Spend your hold as you walk through the area to ask these questions:</p>

<ul><li>Is there a trap here and if so, what activates it?</li>

<li>What does the trap do when activated?</li>

<li>What else is hidden here?</li></ul>

<h3 class="BasicMoveName">Tricks of the Trade</h3>

<p>When you <strong>pick locks or pockets or disable traps</strong>, roll+DEX. • On a 10+, you do it, no problem. • On a 7–9, you still do it, but the GM will offer you two options between suspicion, danger, or cost.</p>

<h3 class="BasicMoveName">Backstab</h3>

<p>When you <strong>attack a surprised or defenseless enemy with a melee weapon</strong>, you can choose to deal your damage or roll+DEX. • On a 10+ choose two. • On a 7–9 choose one.</p>

<ul><li>You don’t get into melee with them</li>

Whenever you have time to gather materials and a safe place to brew you can make three uses of the poison you choose for free. Note that some poisons are applied, meaning you have to carefully apply it to the target or something they eat or drink. Touch poisons just need to touch the target, they can even be used on the blade of a weapon.</p>

<ul><li>Oil of Tagit (applied): The target falls into a light sleep</li>
